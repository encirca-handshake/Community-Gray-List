# Community-Gray-List
Handshake Community Gray Lists

This project in intended to document the policy development and policy implementation for developing and publishing one or more Handshake Community Gray Lists (HCGL).  A HCGL contains TLD’s and SLDs that are perceived to cause consumer harm and confusion.

This project could include, but not be limited to the following:

1.	HCGL Policy Development
a.	Proposed list of categories for unacceptable uses
b.	Criteria for unacceptable use for each category
c.	Identify differences between an overall Handshake TLD versus “staked” TLD (i.e. using someone like Namebase to sell second level domains)
d.	An adjudication process for deciding if a candidate violates a particular AUP category

2.	Potential candidates for each HCGL category
a.	An initial list of Handshake and Namebase candidates for potential assessment


3.	HCGL Policy Implementation
a.	The assessment pipeline and adjudication process for determining whether a TLD or SLD violates the Handshake and/or Staked (i.e. Namebase) Acceptable Use policy
b.	A list repository for each category listing offending TLDs and SLD that third-party tools and vendors can utilize for grey-listing or black-listing
c.	The mechanism for third-party tools, such as Fingertip, Beacon, Opera and Brave to with an appropriate open source license

4.	List of endorsing and participating individuals and organizations

5.	Legal Template
Handshake vendors, such as Namebase could either incorporate or initiate its own community discussion around Gray Lists and then incorporate an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in its contractual terms with TLD Owners and Resellers that enables the vendor and/or its resellers and partners to deny, cancel or otherwise blacklist top-level and second-level registrations that violate its AUP.
